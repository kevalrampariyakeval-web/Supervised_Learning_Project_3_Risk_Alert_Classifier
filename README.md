## 📖 Overview
 
Risk detection plays a critical role in areas like finance, security, fraud detection and compliance monitoring. A missed risky case can lead to serious consequences, while too many false alarms can make a system unreliable and hard to trust.
 
**Risk Alert Classifier** is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built to solve exactly this problem — it takes raw data, cleans it, balances it, trains multiple models, tunes the best one, and picks the final model that offers the strongest trade-off between catching real risks and avoiding false alarms.
 
The notebook is written to be beginner-friendly — every code cell is followed by a short **🧠 Intuition** note that explains, in plain and simple words, what that step is doing and why it matters.

## ❓ Problem Statement
 
Given a dataset with multiple features about a case (numerical + categorical), the goal is to classify each case as:
 
- ✅ **Not Risky** — safe, no alert needed
- ⚠️ **Risky** — potential threat, should be flagged
The challenge isn't just building a model — it's building a model that performs well even when risky cases are rare (class imbalance), and one that minimizes **missed risks (Type-II errors)** without triggering too many **false alarms (Type-I errors)**.

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics Used
 
| Metric | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | Overall correctness of the model |
| **Precision** | How many predicted risky cases were actually risky |
| **Recall** | How many actual risky cases were correctly caught |
| **F1-Score** | Balance between Precision and Recall |
| **Confusion Matrix** | Breakdown of correct vs incorrect predictions |
| **ROC Curve & AUC** | Overall ability of the model to separate risky vs non-risky cases |
 
Special attention is also given to **Type-I errors (false alarms)** and **Type-II errors (missed risks)**, since in a real risk-alert system, missing a genuine risk is usually far more costly than raising an unnecessary alert.

## 🧠 Approach to Class Imbalance
 
Real-world risk data is rarely balanced — risky cases are usually much rarer than safe ones. Training a model directly on such data often makes it biased toward the majority class. To fix this, four different balancing techniques were compared:
 
- **Random Under Sampling** — reduces the majority class
- **Random Over Sampling** — duplicates the minority class
- **SMOTE** — generates new synthetic minority samples
- **ADASYN** — generates more synthetic samples in harder-to-learn regions
Each technique was evaluated fairly using the same test set, so the results reflect real performance differences rather than data leakage.

## 🌟 Models Compared
 
| Model | Type |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Linear baseline model |
| Decision Tree Classifier | Rule-based, easy to interpret |
| Random Forest Classifier | Ensemble of many decision trees |
| Random Forest (RandomizedSearchCV) | Tuned via random hyperparameter search |
| Random Forest (GridSearchCV) | Tuned via exhaustive hyperparameter search |
 
The final model was selected based on the **highest F1-Score**, ensuring a good balance between precision and recall rather than just raw accuracy.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
 
Building a reliable risk alert system isn't just about picking the "best accuracy" model — it's about understanding the real cost of errors, balancing the data fairly, and tuning the model to catch as many genuine risks as possible without overwhelming the system with false alarms.
